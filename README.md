<summary><b>27/08/2023 (2nd Update)</b></summary>
- Upgraded to .Net 6, as curious to try out the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.upgradeassistant">.NET Upgrade Assistant</a>. Verdict: Pretty smooth, at least on a teeny-tiny, small scale &#128513

- Initial Commit (<a href="https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/CodeSmells/tree/master/c-sharp">Repo Source</a>)
<br />
